This mod adds (on the client side) a compilation of the most famous meme sounds i could find. But don't worry, i didnt included any ear hurting sounds.
This might not be a must have mod, but you'll definitly have a good laught even when dying ! Add my other sound mod : EpicKillStreaksAnnouncer for even more sounds rework :)

## Features
Here is a list of in game events that can trigger sounds. Each event has a collection of multiple sounds to pick from.
//TODO

## Config
Not implemented yet. But if i get enought download i'll add the possibility to desactivate some events or sounds.

## Multiplayer
This is a client side mod. That mean that only you can hear the announcer, and that it doesnt affect any other player's game.

## Planned Update
 - On my next mod release, I might have to deploy a compatibility patch on this one (not sure yet).


## Versions
 - 1.0.0 - Initial release
 
## Contact
I'm available on the ROR2 Modding discord server (@Hijack Hornet). 
Please send me feedback! This is third mod so I would really appreciate it.
Even if it's just to say that you like it :)
