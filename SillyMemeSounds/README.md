# Silly Meme Sounds
This mod adds (on the client side) a compilation of the most famous meme sounds I could find. But don't worry, I didn’t include any ear hurting sounds.

This might not be a must-have mod, but you'll definitely have a good laugh even when dying ! Add my other sound mod : EpicKillStreaksAnnouncer for even more sounds rework :)

I've been working on this for quite a long time now but got caught into making my Hj UpdaterAPI.

Right now the mod is working and pretty decent, but "only" include about 25 sounds on the 50 that are planned. But don't worry, this mod will automatically update itself when I add extra content over the next weeks.

## Features

Right now custom sounds play on the following events :
- On run starts
- On enemy hit
- On Preon fire
- On death
- On run win

- And on about 5 other events that I'll let you discover by yourself

## Installation

Please install both this mod and its dependency in your plugin folder.

## Config
Not implemented yet. But that is planned for next week (and once again, this is automatically updated)

## Multiplayer
This is a client-side mod. That mean that only you can hear the sounds, and that it doesn’t affect any other player's game.

## Planned Update
- Adding about 10 others in game events that have a chance of triggering certain sounds.

## Versions

- 1.0.0 - Initial release

## Contact

I'm available on the ROR2 Modding discord server (@Hijack Hornet).
Please send me feedback !
