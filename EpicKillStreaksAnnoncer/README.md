# Epic KillStreaks Announcer
What's more rewarding than an epic announcer commenting on your best kill streaks? This mod adds (on the client side) the famous Unreal Tournament 2004 Announcer to your game! Will you manage to do a monster kill?

## What's new in this update ?
Now work in multiplayer. Also it's way faster than before. I basically re-wrote the all code in the last 2 days (i spent like 20h on this). But here you have it :)

## Features
Whenever you get a kill, the mod registers it and if you managed to reach a certain amount of kills, each one seperated by a maximum of 3seconds (configurable), it will trigger an epic sound.


## Config
You can change the number of kills needed to reach each sound in the config file. By default the values are:

 - Headshot : -1 (deactivated, replace by 1 if you want to activate it)
 - Double kill : -1 (deactivated, replace by 2 if you want to active it)
 - Triple Kill : 3
 - Multi kill : 5
 - Dominating : 8
 - Rampage : 12
 - Ludicrous Kill : 16
 - God like : 20
 - M-M-Monster kill : 25

You can also change the maximum time before the killing streak is reset. By default it's set to 3sec.

## Multiplayer
This is a client side mod. That mean that only you can hear the announcer, and that it doesnt affect any other player's game.
If you are hosting the game however, you are also tracking other players killstreaks, and if one manage to
