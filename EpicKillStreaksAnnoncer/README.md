# SORRY
The 3 first vrsions of the mod were shipped in a hurry and i didn't tested them. Because of that some of you had to install the mod 4 times before it actually worked. I'm sorry for that :/

# Epic KillStreaks Annoncer
What's more rewarding than an epic annoncer commenting on your best kill streaks ? This mod hads (on the client side) the famous Unreal Tournament 2004 Annoncer to your game ! Will you manage to do a monster kill ?

## Features
Whenever you do a kill, the mods register it and if you managed to reach a certain amount of kills each one seperated by a maximum of 3seconds (configurable), it will trigger an epic sound.


## Config
You can change the number of kills needed to reach each sound in the config file. By default the values are :

 - Headshot : -1 (deactivated, replace by 1 if you want it)
 - Double kill : -1 (deactivated, replace by 2 if you want it)
 - Triple Kill : 3
 - Multi kill : 5
 - Dominating : 8
 - Rampage : 12
 - Ludicrous Kill : 16
 - God like : 20
 - M-M-Monster kill : 25

You can also change the maximum time before the killing streak is reseted. By default it's set to 3sec.

## Multiplayer
This is a client side mod. That mean that only you can hear the annoncer, and that it doesnt affect any other player game.
HOWEVER ! At the moment this only work in solo mode or when you are hosting. I'm working onto a fix but that might take some time.
## Planned features
 - Add support for non host games
 - Add support for hearing other players kill streaks
 - Add support for in game message on reaching high kill streaks

## Versions
 - 1.0.0 - Initial release
 - 1.0.4 - No more structure file and the thing is hopfully finally work
