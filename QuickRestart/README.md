# Quick Restart
Are you tired of going through all the menus when you just want to restart your run asap? Then this mod is for you! 

## Features
This mod adds two simple (and configurable) keyboard shortcuts to the game:

 - Press V to restart a new run with the same character/loadout
 - Press B to get back to character selection
## Config
You can change the default key shortcuts by going into the "Risk of Rain 2\BepInEx\config" and editing the file named "com.hijackhornet.quickrestart.cfg"

## Multiplayer
This mod does work in multiplayer even if you play with non modded users (using steam Build I D for instance). However, only the host needs to have this mod installed, and only the host can trigger the restart/return to character select commands.

## Planned features
 - Add a custom button in the pause menu

## Versions
 - 1.0.0 - Initial release
 - 1.0.1 - Fixing the config file issue with mod managers. Please delete the config file from previous version.
 - 1.0.2 - Updating to the lastest BepinEx, R2API and add compatibility with ConfigManager
